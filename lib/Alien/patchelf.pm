=head1 NAME

Alien::patchelf - Alien module for the patchelf utility 


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Alien::patchelf;
    
    my $pe = Alien::patchelf->new;
    my ($stdout, $stderr, @errors)
      = $pe->patchelf('--print-rpath', '/path/to/some/library.so');

    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes you need to change the rpath of binary files,
for example for aliens that are installed in non-standard locations.  
The patchelf utility is used for this purpose.

This is not useful on Windows since dynamic libs are loaded from the PATH.

As with most aliens, if your system provides the patchelf utility
then that will be used.  If not then it will be downloaded and installed for you.  

=head1 METHODS

This module inherits from Alien:::Base so all of those methods are available.

=head2 patchelf

Runs the patchelf command, passing any arguments through.
Uses a C<system> call via L<Capture::Tiny>, and it is up to the caller to handle the results.
